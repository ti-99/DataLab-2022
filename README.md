# Sewanee DataLab 

## What is [DataLab](https://new.sewanee.edu/sewanee-datalab/)?
Sewanee DataLab, a data for social good initiative, is a summer internship which provides professional training and experience in data science by supporting a new
generation of data scientists who work exclusively on social impact projects. Interns commit to social change by learning to use data analysis and related computer 
coding skills to promote data-driven change by organizations serving the public interest.

## My Summer [Project](https://github.com/sewaneedata/betterfi)
Predatory payday, title, and flex loans are a growing affliction in low-income communities that lead people to pay hundreds in interest and fees every month yet 
never pay down their loan. My non-profit partner BetterFi offers those borrowers a pathway out of debt traps and toward financial fitness by refinancing their 
loans at reasonable rates, as well as offering new loans to those who qualify. Using past client data, I will develop predictive models which will create a more 
efficient and scalable way for BetterFi to service the community and end the cycle of debt.
